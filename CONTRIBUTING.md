# Contributing Guidelines

First of all thanks for wanting to contribute to the project, it makes me very happy!

Please follow these guidelines when when contributing

## How can you contribute
### Issues
One way to contribute to the project is by making issues. With issues you can tell me if you want something new to the bot or if you have found a bug. 

When you file a bug make sure that you give as much info as possible:
- where the bug is.
- what happens.
- demostrate the steps.
- include screenshots.
- follow the issue template.
- if the template doesn't add a bug label please add it yourself.

Use the labels to specify your issue. This will make it easy for me to understand and sort things. The *good first issue* is used for newcomers that want to contribute to the code.

### Code
You can also contribute to the code. You can fork the repo!! Commit everything to a new branch that describes your new feature or bug fix. Make a pull request and wait until I review your code. Once everything is working and it is good I will merge the code to master.
> Note: the master branch is the live branch. Everything in there will be deployed to Heroku. **DO NOT** commit anything to the master branch unless it is a documentation/licence/readme fix.


Once again, thank you for deciding to contribute. It means a lot to me.
