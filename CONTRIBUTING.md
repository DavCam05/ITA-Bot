## How can you contribute

You can use issues
When you file a bug make sure that you give as much info as possible:
    where the bug is
    what happens
    demostrate the steps
    include screenshots
    use the bug label to catch my attention

Use the labels to specify your issue. This will make it easy for me to understand and sort things
